### Note

* The `eighth` season was rated as the best by fans, although the `second` had the most viewers.

* Each season took about `a year` to be shot.

```{r, include=F}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F}
views <- data.frame(Season = 1:10,
                    Viewers = c(24.3, 30.0, 24.9, 24, 23.5, 20.7, 20.2, 24.5, 21.8, 22.8))

ggplot(views, aes(x = as.factor(Season), y = Viewers)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", 
           fill = "steelblue") + 
  geom_text(aes(label = Viewers), 
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
            vjust = -0.3) +
  labs(x = "Season",
       y = "Viewers (in millions)",
       title = "Season-to-season changes in viewership")

```

### Remarks 

1. The most watched season had `r max(views$Viewers)` million viewers.

2. The least watched season was Season `r views[views$Viewers == max(views$Viewers),]$Season`, which was watched by about `r max(views$Viewers) - min(views$Viewers)` fewer people than the one mentioned above.
